C-ABI-compatible libc, libm, libpthread, and libunwind interfaces, implemented
in terms of crates written in Rust, such as [rsix], [origin], [sync-resolve],
[libm], [realpath-ext], [memchr], and [parking\_lot]. Currently this only
supports `*-*-linux-gnu` ABIs, though other ABIs could be added.

The goal is to have very little code in `c-scape` itself, by factoring out all
of the significant functionality into independent crates with more
Rust-idiomatic APIs, with `c-scape` just wrapping those APIs to implement the
C ABIs.

This is currently experimental, incomplete, and some things aren't optimized.

c-scape implements `malloc` using the Rust global allocator, and the default
Rust global allocator is implemented using `malloc`, so it's necessary to
enable a different global allocator. The [`mustang`] crate handles this
automatically.

This is part of the [Mustang] project, building Rust programs written entirely
in Rust.
