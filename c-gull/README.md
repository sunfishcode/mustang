c-gull is a libc implementation. It is an implementation of the ABI described
by the [libc] crate.

It is implemented in terms of crates written in Rust, such as [c-scape],
[rustix], [origin], [sync-resolve], [libm], [realpath-ext], [tz-rs], and
[printf-compat].

Currently it only supports `*-*-linux-gnu` ABIs, though other ABIs could be
added in the future. And currently this mostly focused on features needed by
Rust programs, so it doesn't have all the C-idiomatic things like `qsort` yet,
but they could be added in the future.

The goal is to have very little code in c-gull itself, by factoring out all of
the significant functionality into independent crates with more Rust-idiomatic
APIs, with c-gull just wrapping those APIs to implement the C ABIs.

This is currently highly experimental, incomplete, and some things aren't
optimized.

This is part of the [Mustang] project, building Rust programs written entirely
in Rust.

## c-gull's two modes

c-gull has two main cargo features: "take-charge" and "coexist-with-libc". One
of these must be enabled.

In "take-charge" mode, c-gull takes charge of the process, handling program
startup (via origin) providing `malloc` (via c-scape), and other things.

In "coexist-witht-libc" mode, c-gull can be used as a drop-in (partial) libc
replacement in non-mustang builds, provided you're using nightly Rust. To use
it, just change your typical libc dependency in Cargo.toml to this:

```toml
libc = { version = "<c-gull version>", package = "c-gull", features = ["coexist-with-libc"] }
```

and c-gull will replace as many of the system libc implementation with its own
implementations as it can. In particular, it can't replace `malloc` or any of
the pthread functions in this configuration, but it can replace many other
things.

See the [libc-replacement example] for more details.
